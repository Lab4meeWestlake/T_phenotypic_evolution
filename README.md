# T_phenotypic_evolution
The scripts in the folder "t_phenotypic_evolution" were used to analyze the SMRT sequencing data in the manuscript titled 'High temperature delays and low temperature accelerates evolution of a new protein phenotype'. The sequencing data can be found in the folder "T_SMRT_seq".

All files in the folder "t_phenotypic_evolution" are Python scripts (Python 3.10). Please install Python 3.10 on your computer first to run these programs. An example of running the programs below (via the terminal of ubuntu 16.04LTS system):
